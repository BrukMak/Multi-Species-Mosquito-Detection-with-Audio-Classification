# Machine Learning Notebook

This repository contains a machine learning notebook for mosquito species classification using audio data. The notebook implements a deep learning model to classify the species of mosquitoes based on their wingbeat sounds.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: The notebook covers various techniques for preprocessing audio data, including loading, resampling, and feature extraction.
- Model training: It demonstrates the training process of a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras framework.
- Model evaluation: The notebook provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the performance of the trained model.
- Inference: It includes code snippets for making predictions on new audio samples using the trained model.
- Documentation: The notebook is well-documented with comments and explanations of the code and methodologies used.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Librosa, etc.).
3. Open the notebook (`machine_learning_notebook.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions and run each code cell sequentially.
5. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different models, parameters, or datasets.

## Dataset

The notebook utilizes the "Mosquito Wingbeat Sounds" dataset, which contains audio recordings of different mosquito species. The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/potamitis/wingbeats. Please refer to the dataset documentation for more information on its structure and usage.
