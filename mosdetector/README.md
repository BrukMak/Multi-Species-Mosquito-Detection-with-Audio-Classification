# Mobile App for Mosquito Detection

This mobile app allows users to detect mosquito species through audio classification. By recording mosquito wingbeat sounds or uploading WAV files, the app uses a trained machine learning model to predict the presence of different mosquito species.

## Features

- Record audio: Capture mosquito wingbeat sounds through the app's audio recording functionality.
- Upload WAV files: Select and upload pre-recorded mosquito wingbeat sound files in WAV format for species prediction.
- Predict species: Utilize a machine learning model to classify the recorded audio or uploaded WAV files and predict the mosquito species.
- Real-time results: View the predicted mosquito species in real-time after audio recording or file uploading.
- User-friendly interface: Enjoy a simple and intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
